# forecaster
A financial forecasting tool with Monte Carlo simulation support

This is a let's-learn-Python project. It's based on a financial forecasting Excel spreadsheet, which provides the basic math and important constants (elgibility ages, benefit rates, etc.) The data model is entirely unrelated, however.

The Excel sheet was terribly inefficient for Monte Carlo simulations, so one of the goals of the software is to implement these at least somewhat efficiently.

# Planned for Future Versions
Education savings, RESP, and childcare are the key features of v. 2.
